You will either need to guess the location of the car or guess the closest intersection to the car. You can click on the fullscreen button (<i class="bi-arrows-fullscreen"></i>) or click on the image to get a closer look. Once you think you know where the location is, click on the map to make a guess. You can guess as many times as you want before the round timer ends. Only your last guess will be used. If you are confident about your guess you can lock in your guess using the "Lock in" button. Once you are locked in you cannot change your guess. Once the round timer ends or everyone has locked in their guess, the real location will be shown on the map along with everyone\'s guess.</p><h3>Am I allowed to use Google Maps?</h3><p>Decide with your group! If everyone wants to use Google Maps then looking up street signs or business names is a good way to find the location. If you are not allowed to use Google Maps then you will just need to use your natural knowledge of Seattle.</p><h3>How do I play with others?</h3><p>After creating a game, click the share (<i id="shareIcon" class="bi-share"></i>) icon in the navigation bar. This will copy a URL to your clipboard which you can share with others so that they can join your game. You can alternatively share the 9 digit game code with others.</p><h3>Tips and tricks?</h3><ul><li>It\'s always better to guess somewhere than not guess at all as you always gain 1 point for guessing.</li><li>All locations will be on a bike lane and most bike lanes in Seattle are on larger roads.</li><li>You can change the map style using the control in the bottom left corner.</li><li>Use street signs to your advantage. N will usually be north of Denny Way. S will usually be south of Yesler Way. E will usually be east of I-5. W will usually be west of WA-99. Combining two valid directions will also lead you in the right direction, except for south of I-90 and east of I-5. Fun fact: All of the SE roads are on Mercer Island because Mercer Island used to be part of Seattle!</li></ul></div>'
